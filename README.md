# image_resizer4JpgPng
a simple tool to resize images(.jpg and .png) for Windows 11. 
PowerToys are a little bit annoying for me to use. 

Environment ; What you need to run this product
  Python 3.11.7 or above. Im not sure about this but it will be ok.

How to use\n
  Download "resize_images.py". 
  Run cmd. 
  Type 'python resize_images.py {FILE_PATH_of_Source} {FILE_PATH_of_Extract} {WTDTH} {HEIGHT}'. 
  

pretty simple:)

options:
  --blackback
      : when the target images have shorter length than the value you specifed, some blank zones will appear. 
      The blank zones will be filled with white color by defauit. 
      By adding '--blackback'at the end of the command, the blank zones will be filled with black.
